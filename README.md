# Project FeedReader

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We are to write tests using the testing suite [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) ! 


To view, download all files and open the index.html file in your favorite browser.
Review the functionality of the application within your browser. You will see jasmine test suite links located at the bottom.
You can individually test each spec or run them all to ensure all stated tests work as designed.

For further information you can view the documentation for this version of jasmine at (https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction)


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
